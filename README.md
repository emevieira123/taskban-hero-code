# Taskban - Tech Challenge Hero Code

# About the project

## Description

This project was developed as part of a challenge proposed by Hero Code, aiming to assess front-end development skills and the ability to transform a Figma design into code, demonstrating creativity and practical skills in implementation.

The challenge was designed with the intention of simulating a technical test commonly found in job interview selection processes. Approaching this challenge must reflect the same dedication and skills as in a real professional interview situation. The aim is to provide an opportunity to demonstrate technical, practical knowledge and the aptitude to deal with tasks related to front-end development.

## Info Configuration Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
